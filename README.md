### 1. Abstract

Number Guesser is a project assigned during week 2 of the Front-End Engineering program at the Turing School of Software & Design.

The purpose of the assignment is to create an interactive number guessing game. The assignment provides a listing of functionality that must be programmed as well as a static composition that must be recreated as close as possible.

The game features the following programming challenges:

- Multiple buttons and input fields with associated event listeners and functions.
- Dynamically generated content in the form of game cards that appear on the right side of the screen.
- Multiple validation messages that appear based upon detected input.
- Delete buttons located on dynamically generated content that utilize event bubbling to target the correct elements to remove.

Learning goals:

- [x] jQuery fundamentals and syntax
- [x] Traversing, manipulating the DOM
- [x] Event delegation
- [x] CSS grid

### 2. Technology

- JavaScript
- jQuery
- CSS3
- HTML5

### 3. Deployment
